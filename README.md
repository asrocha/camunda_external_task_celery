It make possible connect with the python world, automation, web scraping, RPA, big data, data cience, Machine learn  and so mutch.

Evertthing with python is possible.

All tasks are running asynchronously and distributed geographically or across multiple platforms in a scalable and traceable way.

## Solving the main challenges
* Modeling: mapping python tasks to BPMN models
* Handling fetch and lock duration and working with lock extension for very long tasks.
* Tracking Python tasks. Handling runtime errors, retries, and logs.
